The provider has no influence whatsoever on the current and future design and content of the linked pages. The setting of external links does not mean that the provider adopts the content behind the reference or link as his own. Constant monitoring of the external links is not reasonable for the provider without concrete evidence of legal violations.

    <p>Note on data transfer to the USA</p>
    <p>Our website includes tools from companies based in the USA. When these tools are active, your personal data may be transferred to the US servers of the respective companies. We would like to point out that the USA is not a safe third country within the meaning of EU data protection law. US companies are obliged to release personal data to security authorities without you as the person concerned being able to take legal action against this. It can therefore not be ruled out that US authorities (e.g. secret services) will process, evaluate and permanently store your data on US servers for monitoring purposes. We have no influence on these processing activities.</p>
    <p>Revocation of your consent to data processing</p>
    <p>Many data processing operations are only possible with your express consent. You can revoke consent that you have already given at any time. The legality of the data processing that took place up until the revocation remains unaffected by the revocation.</p>

IF YOUR PERSONAL DATA IS PROCESSED FOR DIRECT ADVERTISING, YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO OBJECT AT ANY TIME TO THE PROCESSING OF YOUR PERSONAL DATA FOR SUCH ADVERTISING PURPOSES; THIS ALSO APPLIES TO PROFILING TO THE EXTENT RELATED TO SUCH DIRECT ADVERTISING. IF YOU OBJECT, YOUR PERSONAL DATA WILL NO LONGER BE USED FOR DIRECT ADVERTISING PURPOSES (OBJECTION ACCORDING TO ART. 21 (2) GDPR).</p>
    <p>Right of appeal to the competent supervisory authority</p>

If you request the direct transfer of the data to another person responsible, this will only be done to the extent that it is technically feasible.</p>
    <p>SSL or TLS encryption</p>
    <p>For security reasons and to protect the transmission of confidential content, such as orders or inquiries that you send to us as the site operator, this site uses SSL or TLS encryption.</p>

    <p>If you dispute the accuracy of your personal data stored by us, we usually need time to check this. For the duration of the examination, you have the right to request that the processing of your personal data be restricted. If the processing of your personal data happened/is happening unlawfully, you can request the restriction of data processing instead of deletion. If we no longer need your personal data, but you need it to exercise, defend or assert legal claims, you have the right to demand that the processing of your personal data be restricted instead of being deleted.

      <p>Data processing by social networks</p>
      <p>We maintain publicly accessible profiles on social networks. The social networks we use in detail can be found below. Social networks such as Facebook, Twitter, etc. can usually analyze your user behavior comprehensively when you visit their website or a website with integrated social media content (e.g. Like buttons or advertising banners). Visiting our social media presence triggers numerous data protection-related processing operations. In detail: If you are logged into your social media account and visit our social media presence, the operator of the social media portal can assign this visit to your user account. Under certain circumstances, however, your personal data may also be collected if you are not logged in or do not have an account with the respective social media portal. In this case, this data is collected, for example, via cookies that are stored on your end device or by recording your IP address. With the help of the data collected in this way, the operators of the social media portals can create user profiles in which your preferences and interests are stored. In this way, interest-based advertising can be displayed to you both inside and outside of the respective social media presence. If you have an account with the respective social network, interest-based advertising can be displayed on all devices on which you are logged in or were logged in. Please also note that we cannot trace all processing operations on the social media portals. Depending on the provider, additional processing operations may therefore be carried out by the operators of the social media portals. Details can be found in the terms of use and data protection regulations of the respective social media portals.</p>
      <p>legal basis</p>
      <p>Our social media appearances should ensure the widest possible presence on the Internet. This is a legitimate interest within the meaning of Article 6 (1) (f) GDPR.

The processed goods are considered reserved goods within the meaning of paragraph 1. If the customer processes, combines or mixes the reserved goods with other goods, we are entitled to co-ownership of the new item in the ratio of the invoice value of the reserved goods to the invoice value of the other goods used. If our ownership expires as a result of connection or mixing, the customer hereby transfers the ownership rights to which he is entitled to the new stock or the item to the extent of the invoice value of the reserved goods and stores them for us free of charge. The resulting co-ownership rights are considered reserved goods within the meaning of paragraph 1. <br /><br />

All intervention costs shall be borne by the client, insofar as they cannot be collected by the third party (opponent of the objection action) and the third-party objection action has been legitimately raised. If the customer pays the purchase price to his customer, he has reserved title to the reserved goods under the same conditions, under which we have reserved ownership upon delivery of the reserved goods; however, the customer is not obliged to reserve ownership of the claims against his customer that will only arise in the future. Otherwise the client is not authorized to resell. <br /><br />

      The customer's claims from the resale of the reserved goods are hereby assigned to us. They serve as security to the same extent as the reserved goods. The customer is only entitled and authorized to resell if it is ensured that the claims to which he is entitled are transferred to us. <br /><br />

      If the customer sells the goods subject to retention of title together with other goods not supplied by us for a total price, the claim from the sale is assigned to the amount of the invoice value of our respective goods subject to retention of title sold. <br /><br />

      The customer is authorized to collect the claims assigned to us until we revoke this. We are entitled to withdraw if the customer does not properly meet his payment obligations from the business relationship with us or if we become aware of circumstances that are likely to significantly reduce the customer's creditworthiness. If the prerequisites for exercising the right of cancellation are met, the customer must, at our request, immediately inform us of the assigned claim and its debtors, provide us with all information required for collection of the claim; to hand over the relevant documents and to notify the debtor of the assignment. We are also entitled to notify the debtor of the assignment ourselves. <br /><br />

The complaint period within the meaning of Section 377 Paragraphs 1 and 2 of the German Commercial Code is 8 days; the receipt of a written message (also by fax) is decisive. The limitation period for claims for defects from goods is two years for consumers and one year for entrepreneurs; this does not apply to a defect that consists of a right in rem of a third party, on the basis of which the return of the item can be demanded. <br /><br />

    2. The goods complained about are to be returned to us in the original or equivalent packaging for inspection. In the event of a justified and timely notice of defects, we will rectify the defects by means of supplementary performance, at our discretion, by rectifying the defect or by delivering an item free of defects. We shall bear the costs of rectifying the defect insofar as these do not increase as a result of the delivery item being sent by the customer to a party other than has been taken to the place of performance. We are entitled to refuse supplementary performance in accordance with the statutory provisions. If supplementary performance is refused, fails or is unreasonable for the client, the client is entitled to withdraw from the contract or to reduce the price (reduction of the remuneration) in accordance with the provisions of Section 3 below. <br /><br />

    3. The customer is only entitled to withdraw from the contract – insofar as withdrawal is not legally excluded – or to reduce the purchase price after the unsuccessful expiry of a reasonable deadline set by him for supplementary performance, unless the setting of a deadline is unnecessary according to the statutory provisions ( § 323 paragraph 2; § 440 BGB, § 441 paragraph 1 BGB). In the event of withdrawal, the customer is liable for deterioration, loss and non-utilization not only for his own customary care, but for any negligent and intentional fault. <br /><br />

    The provisions in Section XI apply to any claims for damages and reimbursement of expenses by the customer. <br /><br />

    In addition to the statutory reasons for refusal, we are also entitled to refuse supplementary performance if and for as long as the customer has not sent us the goods complained about at our request; the customer is not entitled to a right of withdrawal or a right to a price reduction due to such a refusal. The customer is not entitled to rights based on defects if interventions or changes were made to the goods without our consent, unless the customer proves that the defect was not caused by these interventions or changes. <br /><br />

    If the end customer of the object of purchase in the supply chain is a consumer, the customer is entitled to recourse under the statutory provisions (§§ 478, 479 BGTB) under the further conditions of § 377 of the German Commercial Code, but the customer is entitled to any claims for damages and Claims for reimbursement of expenses only in accordance with Section XI. <br /><br />

    A defect does not exist if the delivered goods deviate from the order confirmation as is customary in the industry. In the case of goods that have been sold as declassified or used material, the buyer is not entitled to any claims due to any defects. <br /><br />

    If our operating or maintenance instructions are not followed, changes are made to the deliveries or services, parts are replaced or consumables are used that do not correspond to the original specifications, all warranties are void unless the customer can prove that the defect is not based on this. <br /><br />

    In the case of work, we provide a guarantee by reworking the work free of charge and by reworking or replacing defective material free of charge if you can prove to us that the work was carried out defectively or not professionally. If the rectification fails twice, you have the right to demand a reduction in payment or cancellation of the order. If defects occur that are not caused by improper work, in particular defects due to natural wear and tear as a result of improper treatment or other third-party influences, these are not covered by the warranty. However, the client is only entitled to any claims for damages and reimbursement of expenses in accordance with Section XI.
